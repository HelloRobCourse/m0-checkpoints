// OBJECTIVE: Write a short C++ program that outputs an 8 character  
// mathematical equation that equals 46.

//  TODO:
//  Write a C++ program here that does the following:
 
// Write an assignment statement that will stores the result of a
// formula that is _exactly_ 8 characters (no spaces) and is equal to 46.

// Print to the terminal the equation for your formula as a string
// (no spaces), an equals sign, then the result of the equation. Do
// not just print 46!!
// For example, this would be a valid solution for the number 13 if the 
// result of the equation was stored in a variable called res: 
//   std::cout << "1+4/2+10=" << res << "\n";
// This would be an illegal one (the real result is not 13!!):
//   std::cout << "8-6*1/10=" << 13 << "\n";
